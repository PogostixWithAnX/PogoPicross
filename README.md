# PogoPicross
Picross/Nonogram puzzle game for the Thumby from Tiny Circuits. Comes with over 40 built-in levels, and a guide on how to make your own! Compatible with Thumby Color. Version 1.1.

## FAQ
1. **HOW DO I MAKE CUSTOM LEVELS?** A guide to creating custom level packs can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LuCHmDHdNcXPD8UELjZ-VZ-BLbgADdSr3k3AZvKrtZ4/edit?usp=sharing). The link is also included in LevelCreationGuide.txt, which comes packaged with the game files.
2. **CAN I EDIT/ADAPT THIS?** Yes, HOWEVER. I am 100% Self-Taught which means my code can be Really, Really Weird(tm) and Not Very Professional(tm), so you've been warned. Just keep the CC0 lisence and give me credit for the original if you do decide to go down that rabbit hole.
3. **YOUR PICROSS TUTORIAL SUCKS.** I am aware, but if I wrote a bigger one, it would be like. 10+ screens of text to A through. If you want a better one, I suggest [this one over here.](https://www.thonky.com/nonograms/) They cover both basics and advanced strategies.
4. **WHAT IS THE 3x3 FONT YOU USED FOR THE NUMBERS?** numbers3x3.bin is included in the game files. Keep in mind that it's JUST numbers 0-9, nothing else. If you want a better 3x3 font, Auri in the Thumby Discord made [a very nice one.](https://discord.com/channels/898292107289190461/969074083306299392/998665722081325217)
5. **CAN I PLAY THIS ON THE CODE.THUMBY.US EMULATOR?** As of right now, no. The emulator can't write save data, which is required for various things to work. Also it's really, really, REALLY laggy and kind of awful to play on.
6. **I HAVE A DIFFERENT QUESTION!** Feel free to ask over in the [PogoPicross Thread](https://discord.com/channels/898292107289190461/1360129497466273810) in the Thumby Discord. You can ping me @Pogostix. Just keep in mind my sleep schedule is, uh. Unconventional. So I may not answer right away.

## KNOWN BUGS
**Sometimes pressing B to check the solution, when there is an error, does not work.** It doesn't write an error. It doesn't beep. It does absolutely nothing. I have NO IDEA why this happens, so if you can figure it out, please let me know.
